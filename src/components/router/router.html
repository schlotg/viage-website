  <h2>The Viage Router</h2>
  <p>
    The Viage Router is a simple configurable router that can be a hash, location, or a standalone router.
    For information on the Router API and how to use it go to the <a href="${this.router.createUrl(this.States.API)}">API</a> page.
  </p>
  <h4>Design Goals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make it as simple and as easy to use as possible</li>
    <li>Don't worry about backwards compatability with older browsers such as IE</li>
    <li>Support a routing mode that doesn't need to use the DOM's location and History API (Standalone)</li>
    <li>Support a routing mode that doesn't need to reload the page (Hash)</li>
    <li>Support a routing mode that does reload the page (Location)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Router Types</h4>
  <h5>HTML5 Router</h5>
  <p>
    HTML5 supports the concept of a router via history.pushState(), history.replaceState(), and the onpopstate event.
    The rules are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        history.pushState/replaceState adds a new entry to the history queue, changes the title bar, but does not
        cause a reload or fire the popstate event.
      </li>
      <li>
        The onpopstate event is fired when a back or forward button is pressed or a traverse from one pushed State to another.
        The browser will not reload the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        None of these things impact assigning a location.href value or clicking an anchor. This means that implementing
        a router based on this API cannot use anchors, links, or location.href with out triggering a reload.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Hash Router</h5>
  <p>
    A Hash router relies on the fact that # links do not cause browser reloads. All state changes have to be encoded as a
    hash route. To detect external changes you can listen to the onpopstate event and the hashchange event. This type of
    router works well with history.back(), anchors, links, and location.href assignments. It does not cause the browser to
    load new files. Although you can certainly code up a hash router to dynamically load chunks of code based on state.
  </p>
  <h5>Location Router</h5>
  <p>
    This type of Router just loads a new location, but when the application loads, the location is examined to determine the state.
    This type of router does not need to listen to any events. However, this type of router relies on some server functionality
    to always serve up index.html when it can't resolve the file path. You can get around this by using the url parameter syntax
    and store the state info as a parameter and always load index.html. This type of router causes a browser load on every state
    or url change.
  </p>
  <h5>Standalone Router</h5>
  <p>
    This type of router doesn't use the Location or History objects and must be called directly to go to a new location or to go back.
    It simply renders the result of the current state into a designated portal.
  </p>
  <h5>Problems that routers suffer from (except standalone)</h5>
  <p>
    Some libraries, such as Bootstrap, assign '#' to anchors and then capture the click event. When the object is clicked, this adds
    a history entry. To go back, one must cycle through these hash entries which can be annoying and a unexpected behavior. Avoid code
    that creates hash entries in the browser's history.
  </p>
  <h5>Misc</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All of the above routers, expect standalone, should look at the location when they start and change to the appropriate state on load.
      This allows links to be stored that take the user directly to the state from which the link was captured.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is a good idea to implement an API to create a URL based on state and parameters. This makes generating links less error
      prone and removes any guess work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inside a web app, consider not using any # urls outside of hash router states. Anchor tags won't have an underlined link look
      if nothing is assigned to the href attribute. This is why many people assign '#' and then add a click handler. I would avoid
      this altogether. You can always style text to look like an anchor or link.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider not having one big page with anchor points. Instead, use multiple router pages to display the info and avoid hash
      anchor points all together.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Final Design</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I decided to rule out the HTML5 router. Not being able to use links, anchors, and href will just make it to painful to use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because Hash, Location, and Standalone are very similar, for maximum flexability I implemented all three routing in one class.
      The type of router is just a configuration item.
    </li>
    <li>
      To prevent issues with servers having to be specially configured, I am going to store the route state as a url param so the
      server will always try to serve the same location.
    </li>
  </ul>
